## Introduction

In 2020, UNAIDS newly released the 95-95-95 targets which are set to be achieved by 2025, where 95% of PLHIV know their status, 95% of those who know their status are accessing treatment, and 95% of those who are accessing treatment are virally suppressed.

Importantly, there are two types of metrics to measure 95-95-95 target progress by: **the PLHIV base** and the **relative/conditional denominator** base. This vignette will outline the key differences between the two metrics, which UNAIDS indicators to use for each, and how to interpret the different parameters.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(mindthegap)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(glue)
library(gt)
library(gtExtras)
library(glamr) #install.packages('glamr', repos = c('https://usaid-oha-si.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))
library(glitr) #install.packages('glitr', repos = c('https://usaid-oha-si.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))
```

### What's the difference between the relative base and the PLHIV base?

The **relative base or conditional denominator** (based on the targets) is important for countries and programs to know where to focus their response. This metric provides values on a sliding scale, where 95% of PLHIV know their status, 95% of those who know their status are accessing treatment, and 95% of those who are accessing treatment are virally suppressed.

The **PLHIV base/denominator** (testing and treatment cascade) is best used for comparing countries and for knowing country-specific progress towards curbing their HIV epidemic. With PLHIV as the base for the 3 95's, the targets become 95% of PLHIV known their status, 90% of PLHIV are accessing treatment, and 86% of PLHIV are virally suppressed.

Both are useful, but for different purposes (see visual below).

knitr::include_graphics("unaids-95s.png", dpi = 150, error = FALSE)
```

### How to use UNAIDS Data to Assess 95's Progress

To assess progress to 95-95-95 targets, we will use the `"HIV Test & Treat"` data and filter for `"Percent"` indicators:

```{r, message = FALSE}
df_tt <- pull_unaids(data_type = "HIV Test & Treat", pepfar_only = TRUE) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(indic_type == "Percent")

```

-   If you are using the **relative base** to track 95-95-95 progress, use the following indicators from the `"HIV Test & Treat"` data tab.
    -   **`Percent Known Status of PLHIV`**: Percent of PLHIV who known their HIV status
    -   **`Percent on ART with Known Status`**: Among those who know their status, percent on ART
    -   **`Percent VLS on ART`**: Among those who are on ART, percent virally suppressed
-   If you are using the **PLHIV base**, use the following indicators from the `"HIV Test & Treat"` data tab.
    -   **`Percent Known Status of PLHIV`**: Percent of PLHIV who known their HIV status
    -   **`Percent on ART of PLHIV`**: Among PLHVIV, percent on ART
    -   **`Percent VLS of PLHIV`**: Among PLHIV, percent virally suppressed

Let's take a deep dive into Namibia's progress to the 95's using the PLHIV base.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
goal <- 95

 #limit Test and Treat data
  df_tt_plhiv <- df_tt %>% 
    filter(year == max(year),
           country == "Namibia",
           indicator %in% c("Percent Known Status of PLHIV",
                            "Percent on ART of PLHIV",
                            "Percent VLS of PLHIV"), #Using the PLHIV base indicators
           age == "All",
           sex == "All") %>% 
    mutate(set = recode(indicator, "Percent Known Status of PLHIV" = 1, 
                        "Percent on ART of PLHIV" = 2,
                        "Percent VLS of PLHIV" = 3),
           goal_rate = round((goal/100)^set*100), 
           achieved = estimate >= goal_rate) %>% #sets the moving goal rate for each 95 for PLHIV base
    select(year, country, indicator, estimate, goal_rate, achieved)
  
  #create table 
  year <- unique(df_tt_plhiv$year)
  
  gt(df_tt_plhiv) %>% 
    cols_hide(c(year, country)) %>% 
    fmt_percent(columns = c(estimate, goal_rate),
	                  decimals = 0, scale_values = FALSE) %>% 
	      cols_label(goal_rate = "goal") %>% 
	      gtExtras::gt_theme_nytimes() %>% 
	      tab_source_note(source_note = gt::md(glue(source_note))) %>% 
	      tab_options(source_notes.font.size = px(8),
	                  data_row.padding = px(1),
	                  table.font.size = px(12)) %>% 
	      gt_color_rows(achieved,
	                    palette = c(glitr::burnt_sienna, glitr::scooter),
	                    domain = c(0,1),
	                    pal_type = "discrete") %>% 
	      tab_header(title = glue("NAMIBIA'S {year} TREATMENT TARGET GOALS: PLHIV BASE")) 

```

As we can see, using the PLHIV base, Namibia reached one of the 95's - 93% of PLHIV know their status, 89% of PLHIV are accessing treatment, and 87% of PLHIV are virally suppressed.

What happens if we use the relative base?

```{r, message = FALSE}
goal <- 95

 #limit Test and Treat data
  df_tt_rel <- df_tt %>% 
    filter(year == max(year),
           country == "Namibia",
           indicator %in% c("Percent Known Status of PLHIV",
                            "Percent on ART with Known Status",
                            "Percent VLS on ART"), #using rel base indicators
           age == "All",
           sex == "All") %>%
    mutate(goal_rate = goal, #use 95 as the goal metric for each indicator
           achieved = estimate >= goal_rate) %>% 
    select(year, country, indicator, estimate, goal_rate, achieved)


#create table
   year <- unique(df_tt_rel$year)
   
      gt(df_tt_rel) %>% 
	      cols_hide(c(year, country)) %>% 
	      fmt_percent(columns = c(estimate, goal_rate),
	                  decimals = 0, scale_values = FALSE) %>% 
	      cols_label(goal_rate = "goal") %>% 
	      gtExtras::gt_theme_nytimes() %>% 
	      tab_source_note(source_note = gt::md(glue(source_note))) %>% 
	      tab_options(source_notes.font.size = px(8),
	                  data_row.padding = px(1),
	                  table.font.size = px(12)) %>% 
	      tab_header(title =glue("NAMIBIA'S {year} TREATMENT TARGET GOALS: RELATIVE BASE")) %>% 
      gt_color_rows(achieved,
	                    palette = c(glitr::burnt_sienna, glitr::scooter),
	                    domain = c(0,1),
	                    pal_type = "discrete")

```

Using the relative base, we can see that 93% of PLHIV in Namibia know their status, 95% of the 93% who know their status are on treatment, and 98% of the 95% who are on treatment are virally suppressed. As such, Namibia meets the 2nd and 3rd 95 with the relative base, but does not reach the 1st 95.

As a result of these differences between the 2 metrics, the number of PEPFAR countries that have reached all of the 95's can vary depending on the denominator.

With the PLHIV base, 7 countries have reached all 3 95's: **Botswana, Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe**.

                         "Percent VLS of PLHIV"), #Using the PLHIV base indicators

                          "Percent VLS of PLHIV" = 3),
             goal_rate = round((goal/100)^set*100), 
             achieved = estimate >= goal_rate
             ) %>% #sets the moving goal rate for each 95 for PLHIV base
      select(country, indicator, estimate, achieved) %>%

                 values_from = "estimate",
                names_glue = "{indicator %>% stringr::str_extract_all('Status|ART|VLS') %>% tolower}"
               ) %>%

                   art = "On ART",
                   vls = "VLS") %>%
