## Introduction

In 2014, UNAIDS proposed the 90-90-90 targets which were set to be achieved by 2020, where 90% of PLHIV know their status, 90% of those who know their status are accessing treatment, and 90% of those who are accessing treatment are virally suppressed.

Importantly, there are two types of metrics to measure 90-90-90 target progress by: **the PLHIV base** and the **relative/conditional denominator** base. This vignette will outline the key differences between the two metrics, which UNAIDS indicators to use for each, and how to interpret the different parameters.

### What's the difference between the relative base and the PLHIV base? 

The **relative base or conditional denominator** (based on the targets) is important for countries and programs to know where to focus their response. This metric provides values on a sliding scale, where 90% of PLHIV know their status, 90% of those who know their status are accessing treatment, and 90% of those who are accessing treatment are virally suppressed.

The **PLHIV base/denominator** (testing and treatment cascade) is best used for comparing countries and for knowing country-specific progress towards curbing their HIV epidemic. With PLHIV as the base for the 3 90's, the targets become 90% of PLHIV known their status, 81% of PLHIV are accessing treatment, and 73% of PLHIV are virally suppressed.

Both are useful, but for different purposes (see visual below).

### How to use UNAIDS Data to Assess 90's Progress

To assess progress to 90-90-90 targets, we will use the `"Test & Treat - Percent"` data:

```{r, message = FALSE}
df_tt <- pull_unaids(sheetname = "Test & Treat - Percent", pepfar_only = TRUE)
```

- If you are using the **relative base** to track 90-90-90 progress, use the following indicators from the `"Test & Treat - Percent"` data tab.
    - **`KNOWN_STATUS`**: Percent of PLHIV who known their HIV status
    - **`KNOWN_STATUS_ON_ART`**: Among those who know their status, percent on ART
    - **`ON_ART_VLS`**: Among those who are on ART, percent virally suppressed
    
- If you are using the **PLHIV base**, use the following indicators from the "Test & Treat - Percent" data tab.
    - **`KNOWN_STATUS`**: Percent of PLHIV who known their HIV status
    - **`PLHIV_ON_ART`**: Among PLHVIV, percent on ART
    - **`VLS`**: Among PLHIV, percent virally suppressed
    
Let's take a deep dive into Kenya's progress to the 90's using the PLHIV base.    
```{r, message = FALSE}
goal <- 90

 #limit Test and Treat data
  df_tt_plhiv <- df_tt %>% 
    filter(year == max(year),
           country == "Kenya",
           indicator %in% c("KNOWN_STATUS", "PLHIV_ON_ART", "VLS"), #Using the PLHIV base indicators
           age == "all",
           sex == "all",
           stat == "est") %>% 
    mutate(set = recode(indicator, "KNOWN_STATUS" = 1, 
                        "PLHIV_ON_ART" = 2,
                        "VLS" = 3),
           goal_rate = round((goal/100)^set*100), 
           achieved = value >= goal_rate) %>% #sets the moving goal rate for each 90 for PLHIV base
    select(year, country, indicator, value, goal_rate, achieved)

knitr::kable(df_tt_plhiv,
             format = "html",
             caption = "Kenya's 90-90-90 Progress using PLHIV Base") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover"))

```  

As we can see, using the PLHIV base, Kenya reached all 3 90's - 96% of PLHIV know their status, 86% of PLHIV are accessing treatment, and 81% of PLHIV are virally suppressed.

What happens if we use the relative base?

```{r, message = FALSE}
goal <- 90

 #limit Test and Treat data
  df_tt_rel <- df_tt %>% 
    filter(year == max(year),
           country == "Kenya",
           indicator %in% c("KNOWN_STATUS", "KNOWN_STATUS_ON_ART", "ON_ART_VLS"), #using relative base indicators
           age == "all",
           sex == "all",
           stat == "est") %>%
    mutate(goal_rate = goal, #use 90 as the goal metric for each indicator
           achieved = value >= goal_rate) %>% 
    select(year, country, indicator, value, goal_rate, achieved)

knitr::kable(df_tt_rel,
             format = "html",
             caption = "Kenya's 90-90-90 Progress using the Relative Base") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover"))

```

Using the relative base, we can see that 96% of PLHIV in Kenya know their status, 89% of the 96% who know their status are on treatment, and 94% of the 89% who are on treatment are virally suppressed. As such, Kenya meets the 1st and 3rd 90 with the relative base, but does not reach the 2nd 90.  

As a result of these differences between the 2 metrics, the number of PEPFAR countries that have reached all of the 90s varies depending on the denominator.

With the relative base, 6 countries have reached all 3 90's: **Eswatini, Rwanda, Malawi, Botswana, Uganda, and Namibia**.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("6-countries-relative-base.png", dpi = 150)
```

With the PLHIV base, the list of countries expands from 6 to 9 countries that have reached all 3 90's, adding **Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Lesotho**.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("9-countries-PLHIV-base.png", dpi = 150)
